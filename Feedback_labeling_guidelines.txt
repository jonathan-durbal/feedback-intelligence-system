# Feedback Labeling Guidelines for Google Drive

This document defines how to assign structured labels to customer feedback. These guidelines ensure consistent output from the labeling system and support future integrations with PM tools like Jira.

## 1. Summary

Provide a one-sentence restatement of the core issue or request.

- Focus on what happened, not opinions.
- Avoid adding details that are not explicitly mentioned or implied.

## 2. Sentiment

Classify sentiment based on the user's wording and tone.

- Positive: User expresses satisfaction or appreciation.
- Neutral: User describes an issue or observation without emotion.
- Negative: User expresses frustration, dissatisfaction, or urgency.

If mixed, choose the strongest sentiment conveyed.

## 3. Urgency (Low / Medium / High)

Based on how time-sensitive or blocking the issue is.

- Low: Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issue, slow performance not blocking workflow.
- Medium: Impacts workflow but has a workaround; causes repeated frustration.
- High: Blocks progress, prevents file access, risks missed deadlines, or implies potential data loss.

## 4. Risk Flag

Identify high-level risks implied by the feedback.

- Usability Risk: User confusion, unclear UI behavior, unintuitive workflows.
- Reliability Risk: Sync failures, unpredictable results, inconsistent behavior.
- Security / Access Control Risk: Unexpected sharing behavior, unsafe defaults.
- Performance Risk: Slowness, freezes, delays.
- Data Integrity Risk: Missing files, sync conflicts, lost edits.
- Churn Risk: User indicates they may stop using Drive due to repeated issues.
- Competitive Threat: User references switching to another service.

Choose one or two most relevant.

## 5. Product Area

Map feedback to one Drive feature or system component.

Available product areas:
- Upload & Sync
- Sharing & Permissions
- Shared Drives
- Search & Indexing
- File Preview / Viewing
- Version History
- Offline Access
- Notifications
- General Performance

If unclear, choose the area most directly implied.

CRITICAL RULE FOR VAGUE FEEDBACK:
- If feedback only says "slow", "laggy", "everything is broken" WITHOUT mentioning a specific feature, use "General Performance"
- DO NOT assign specific product areas unless the feedback explicitly mentions that feature

## 6. Suggested User Story

Follow the standard product story format:

"As a [persona], I want [change] so that [benefit]."

- Base persona on feedback context where possible.
- Keep scope appropriate (not too large or vague).
- Ensure story aligns with Drive's constraints and capabilities.

## 7. Priority Recommendation (Low / Medium / High)

Reflects product/business importance, not user emotion.

- Low: Minor inconvenience, low impact on the majority of users.
- Medium: Affects common workflows or several users; needs attention soon.
- High: Critical issue impacting many users or high-risk areas (access, sync, data integrity).

Use urgency as input, but not the only factor.

## 8. Jira Type

Choose the ticket category a PM would likely log:

- Bug: Something is broken or behaving incorrectly.
- Feature Request: User asks for new capability.
- Improvement: Existing feature works but could be better.
- Task: Non-user-facing work needed (documentation, cleanup).

## 9. Suggested Owner Team

Based on product area:

- Sync Team → Uploading, syncing, conflicts
- Search Team → Search, indexing, filtering
- Sharing Team → Permissions, link sharing
- Shared Drives Team → Team drive behavior
- Offline Team → Offline availability and sync
- Docs/Sheets Team → Editing-specific issues
- Frontend Web Team → UI/UX issues on web
- Mobile Team → Mobile-specific bugs or flows

Choose the closest functional owner.

## 10. Notes

Freeform short field for:

- Additional clarifications
- Potential reproduction steps
- Observations about patterns
- Links to similar items
- PM triage comments

Keep notes short and factual.
