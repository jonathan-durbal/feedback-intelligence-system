## 1. Upload & Sync UX Rules

- Upload progress indicators must update in real time.
- Error states must show a clear cause and actionable fix (e.g., retry, insufficient storage).
- Sync indicators must show when files are uploading, processing, or completed.
- Duplicate files should not be created silently; user must be notified if conflicts occur.
- Interrupted uploads must resume automatically once connection returns.

## 2. Sharing UX Rules

- Sharing dialog must clearly show current permission level (Viewer, Commenter, Editor).
- Link-sharing state must be visible immediately (restricted, domain-only, anyone with link).
- "Request access" actions must notify the file owner promptly.
- Access changes must provide a confirmation message.
- Users should not lose access unexpectedly when reordering folders.

## 3. Search Experience Rules

- Search suggestions must appear within fractions of a second.
- Filters (type, owner, modified date) must apply consistently across platforms.
- Recent files and frequently opened items should rank higher when relevant.
- Results must update quickly after new uploads or edits.
- Long queries should degrade gracefully, showing partial matches.

## 4. Shared Drives UX Rules

- Top-level permissions must be visible and editable only by managers.
- Subfolders should inherit permissions unless intentionally overridden.
- Role labels must be descriptive enough for new users to understand access differences.
- Deleted items must stay in Shared Drive trash, not personal trash.
- Dragging files between Shared Drives must show role-related warnings.

## 5. Version History UX Rules

- Users should see clear timestamps and authors for each version.
- Restoring a version must preserve the current version as an accessible backup.
- Version history should maintain readability even for files with many edits.
- Users should be able to name important versions.
- Version history must never silently discard edits.

## 6. Offline Access UX Rules

- Offline-enabled files must display a clear offline indicator.
- Editing offline must not produce silent errors.
- Drive must sync changes automatically upon reconnection.
- Sync conflicts must show a clear comparison of differing versions.
- Unsupported file types must show a message when offline editing is not available.

## 7. General UX Consistency Rules

- UI elements related to file status (owned, shared, offline, starred) must be consistent across web and mobile.
- All major actions should offer undo steps when possible.
- Notifications must not appear out of order or multiple times for the same event.
- Loading states should be brief and not block core interactions.
- Error states should avoid technical jargon and explain next steps clearly.
