# Google Drive Performance Issues Guide

## Common Performance Complaints

Users frequently report the following performance-related issues:

### General Slowness
- "Everything is slow"
- "Drive is laggy"
- "Interface feels sluggish"
- "Pages take forever to load"

When feedback mentions general slowness without specifying a feature, this indicates a broad performance issue that should be categorized as "General Performance" rather than a specific product area.

## Performance Issue Categories

### 1. Upload Performance Issues
Keywords: slow upload, upload taking forever, stuck uploading, upload freezes, upload at 99%

Common causes:
- Network bandwidth limitations
- Large file size requiring chunked uploads
- Server processing delays
- Intermittent connection interruptions

Product Area: Upload & Sync

### 2. Sync Performance Issues
Keywords: slow sync, sync delays, changes not appearing, sync lag

Common causes:
- Background sync queue backlog
- Conflict resolution processing
- Multiple device sync coordination
- Network latency

Product Area: Upload & Sync

### 3. Search Performance Issues
Keywords: slow search, search taking forever, results loading slowly, search lag

Common causes:
- Indexing delays after large uploads
- Complex query processing
- Large result set filtering
- Mobile platform limitations

Product Area: Search & Indexing

### 4. Loading Performance Issues
Keywords: slow loading, pages loading slowly, interface lag, UI freezes, unresponsive

Common causes:
- Large folder tree rendering
- Metadata fetching delays
- Client-side processing bottlenecks
- Network latency

Product Area: General Performance

### 5. Preview Performance Issues
Keywords: preview slow, PDF taking forever, file preview lag

Common causes:
- Large file rendering
- Format conversion delays
- Client-side processing

Product Area: File Preview / Viewing

### 6. Shared Drive Performance Issues
Keywords: Shared Drive slow, team drive lag, folder loading slowly in Shared Drive

Common causes:
- Large metadata payloads
- Complex permission structures
- Multiple folder levels

Product Area: Shared Drives

## Performance Constraints from Product Architecture

From Known Constraints:
- Upload speed depends on user bandwidth and device performance
- Very large files require chunked uploads and may fail on unstable networks
- Drive cannot guarantee real-time sync across slow or intermittent connections
- Newly uploaded files may not appear in search results immediately due to indexing delay
- Folder reorganization in large Shared Drives may temporarily reduce performance

## Decision Rules for Performance Feedback

RULE 1: Vague Performance Complaints
If feedback only mentions "slow", "laggy", "performance" WITHOUT specifying which feature:
→ Product Area: General Performance
→ Risk Flag: Performance Risk
→ Do NOT guess which specific feature is slow

RULE 2: Feature-Specific Performance
If feedback says "uploading is slow" or "search is slow":
→ Product Area: The specific feature mentioned (Upload & Sync, Search & Indexing, etc.)
→ Risk Flag: Performance Risk
→ Reference relevant constraints from documentation

RULE 3: Multiple Performance Issues
If feedback mentions multiple slow areas:
→ Product Area: General Performance
→ Notes: Mention that multiple areas are affected
→ Risk Flag: Performance Risk

## Example Performance Feedback Classifications

Example 1: "Everything loads so slowly, it's unusable"
- Product Area: General Performance
- Risk Flag: Performance Risk
- Notes: User reports broad performance degradation across interface

Example 2: "File uploads are extremely slow"
- Product Area: Upload & Sync
- Risk Flag: Performance Risk
- Notes: May be related to bandwidth constraints or file size

Example 3: "Searching for files takes forever"
- Product Area: Search & Indexing
- Risk Flag: Performance Risk
- Notes: Possible indexing delays or large result set processing

Example 4: "The whole app freezes when I open large Shared Drives"
- Product Area: Shared Drives
- Risk Flag: Performance Risk
- Notes: Known issue with large folder trees and metadata payloads
