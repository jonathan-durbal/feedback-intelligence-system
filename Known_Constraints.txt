## 1. File Upload & Sync Constraints

- Upload speed depends on user bandwidth and device performance.
- Very large files require chunked uploads and may fail on unstable networks.
- Sync conflicts occur when a user edits a file offline while another user edits the same file online.
- Drive cannot guarantee real-time sync across slow or intermittent connections.

## 2. Storage & File Type Constraints

- Maximum file size varies by account type and file format.
- Some third-party file formats have limited preview or indexing capabilities.
- Offline access is restricted to a set of supported file types (Docs, Sheets, Slides).
- Certain media files cannot be stored offline due to size or format limitations.

## 3. Search & Indexing Constraints

- Newly uploaded files may not appear in search results immediately due to indexing delay.
- Complex queries or ambiguous keywords may produce inconsistent relevance.
- Search on mobile devices supports fewer filter options than desktop.
- Indexing does not process encrypted or password-protected files.

## 4. Sharing & Permissions Constraints

- Public link sharing may be restricted by organizational policies.
- Shared folder inheritance can lead to unexpected permission behavior if not configured correctly.
- Files moved between Shared Drives may require re-evaluation of roles or access levels.
- A user with insufficient permissions may see the file but not open it, depending on settings.

## 5. Shared Drive Constraints

- Shared Drives do not support transferring personal files without proper permissions.
- Deleted files go to the Shared Drive trash and remain visible to certain roles.
- Only managers can change top-level access settings.
- Folder reorganization in large Shared Drives may temporarily reduce performance.

## 6. Version History Constraints

- Not all file types support full version tracking.
- Restoring a version overwrites the current file state (though the overwritten state becomes a restorable version).
- Detailed change attribution may be unavailable for older versions.
- Large or highly edited files may have limited version granularity.

## 7. Offline Access Constraints

- Offline editing is not available for non-Google formats.
- Device storage limits may prevent marking large files offline.
- Offline capabilities require prior device authentication.
- Sync conflicts may still occur when reconnecting.

## 8. Platform Limitations (General)

- Some Drive actions behave differently on mobile vs desktop.
- Local file system constraints may impact desktop client behavior.
- Drive depends heavily on stable network connectivity for real-time operations.
